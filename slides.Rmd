# Learning Goals for this Week

* Familiarise yourself with the coding tools we use in the course
* Increase confidence in your coding abilities
* Acquire skills to conduct reproducible data analysis

**How**: DataCamp

* Won't need to have tools installed to start learning
* Exercise based learning

# What You Will Learn 

1. Introduction to Command Line Programming 
2. Version Control with Git and GitHub 
3. Introduction to R and the `tidyverse`
4. Introduction to R Markdown

**There's quite a bit to work through...** <br> $\implies$ *don't* leave this to the last minute

# Why this is Important

* Starting point for the analysis in this class 
  * We want everyone to start from the same blocks
* Skills will generalise to all analytics tasks 
  * In your degree 
  * And in your future careers 
    * ... tools we teach are tools that industry uses

# Command Line Programming 

* Move away from 'point and click' to typed instructions
* Your main focus:
  * Navigating your file system
  * Creating, moving, copying files
  * Looking at contents of a file

---
class: font120
# Version Control with Git and GitHub 

* Manage changes made to files systematically

* Git: records changes made to files 
  - Can rewind
  - No 'conflicted copy' errors
  - Easy to collaborate

* GitHub: a place to store version controlled projects (online)
  - A central hub
  - Facilitates collaboration within teams

* Your main focus:
  - How to make and track changes, reverse them
  - How to share these changes online with collaborators
  - Solve conflicts between different version histories

# Introduction to R and the tidyverse

* `R`: a program for statistical / data - intensive analysis
  - `R` plus its package ecosystem contains everything we need for this course: network analysis, text analysis and econometrics
  - ... and a *lot* more

* `tidyverse`: opinionated collection of R packages for data Science
  - Similar design philosophy, grammar and data structures $\implies$ consistent syntax

* Your main focus:
  - Loading data from a file
  - Data manipulation using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
  - Plotting with `ggplot2`

# Introduction to R Markdown

* R Markdown: a file format to integrate code, results and written reports

* Your main focus:
  * How to create an R Markdown document
  * How to add analyses and plots produced with R to a written document
  * How to organise a report

# After DataCamp

**How can I put everything I have learned together?**

* Work through: ["How to Use Git/GitHub with R"](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/)
  * Walk through an example workflow
  * Write some `R` code, commit changes with Git, undo some progress with Git

# After DataCamp  

**How can I put everything I have learned together?**

* Git in in this class:
  - Cloning weekly Lab material & making changes 
  - Accepting and Submitting Assignments

* Practice the workflows on the [course website](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2021-smwa/coding_tips/)
  * We will provide particular examples as needed
